COMPONENT NOTES:

Component Roles:
	
	THINKING:
		This component is like a mini brain. It gathers information from SENSE
		components and controls LIMB components.
	
	LIMB:
		This component is a tool. It does things, but it needs to be controlled
		by a THINKING component.
		
		If a LIMB component acts/ can act without a THINKING component controlling
		it, call it an INDEPENDENT LIMB
	
	SENSE:
		This component observes, gathers, and redistributes information. Ideally
		it should should never control anything or perform any LIMB tool like 
		actions.
	
	~HYBRID:
		This role is used when a component doesn't perfectly fit one of the
		roles above. Add any fitting roles to the role name, including names of 
		other roles that are most fitting in order of: most alike -> least alike,
		and make the role names lower case if they are only "sort of" fitting.
	
	Add the role names above to the script as a comment after the class name, or
	otherwise near the top of the script
	
	Examples:
		DetectionAreaComponent - this is a SENSE component. It doesn't control
		anything, and doesn't act on anything in the scene. It only keeps track
		of entities that are within its radius.
		
		TargetTrackerComponent - this is a LIMB component. It retains its ability
		to do actions (turn and look) without aid, but it needs to be told WHEN
		to do that and WHAT to look at by a THINKING component.
		
		TargetAcquisitionComponent - this is a THINKING component. It uses the
		info the DetectionAreaComponent gathers to tell the TargetTrackerComponent
		what to track.
	
	Exceptions, HYBRID components:
		Some components may have multiple roles when it makes little sense to 
		separate them into multiple components.
		
		HealthComponent - this is an example of a hybrid component. It most 
		closely matches a LIMB component, because it has functionality to DO
		things, like kill the entity if health reaches 0. It also stores info
		regarding remaining health for other components to use, similar to a 
		SENSE component, but it needs to be TOLD to update info by a THINKING
		component. I would call the HealthComponent a "#LIMB, sense" component
		
		These roles aren't 100 percent static, and new ones could be added in
		future as I learn, but I think having some role based way of thinking of
		nodes helps to make sure one isn't becoming too multi-purpose.
